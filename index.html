  <title>Frontend Mentor Challenges</title>

<body>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>This is my collection of solutions to Frontend Mentor challenges. Within each solution will be a README.md file with requirements for the challenge</p>

  <p>My goal for each solution was to write semantic HTML, organized and effective modern CSS, and minimal JavaScript if needed. I attempted to follow the mockup and style guide like this was an assignment from a professional  agency.</p>
